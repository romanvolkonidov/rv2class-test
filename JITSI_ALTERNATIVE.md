# Jitsi Self-Hosted on Fly.io - BETTER SOLUTION!

## Why Jitsi Instead of BBB for You:

You have:
- 2 teachers
- 1-on-1 lessons (not group classes)
- Budget-conscious

**Jitsi is PERFECT because:**
- ‚úÖ Lightweight (runs on Fly.io free tier!)
- ‚úÖ Designed for small meetings
- ‚úÖ **Cost: $0-5/month** (vs BBB $40+/month)
- ‚úÖ Same reliability as BBB for 1-on-1
- ‚úÖ All existing URLs still work

## Deployment Options

### Option A: Use Public Jitsi (FREE, 2 minutes)
**Best for immediate deployment**

Just update your frontend to use public Jitsi:
- No server needed!
- Free forever
- Works immediately
- Perfect for 1-on-1

Cost: **$0/month**

### Option B: Self-Host Jitsi on Fly.io (5 minutes)
**For privacy/branding**

Deploy your own Jitsi instance
- Full control
- Your domain
- Private

Cost: **$0-10/month**

### Option C: Hosted BBB (if you really need BBB features)
**Only if you need:**
- Breakout rooms
- Polling
- Presentation uploads

Cost: **$100/month**

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED: Option A (Free Public Jitsi)

This is the BEST option for your needs!

### Step 1: Update Your Code (5 minutes)

I'll create a Jitsi integration that:
- Uses free Jitsi servers
- Works with all your existing URLs
- Costs $0
- Deploy to Vercel (where you already are)

### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
# Just push to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Done!
- No BBB server needed
- No Fly.io needed
- Keep using Vercel
- All existing student links work

## Cost Comparison

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Setup Time | For Your Use Case |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Public Jitsi** | **$0** | **2 min** | ‚úÖ **PERFECT** |
| Self-hosted Jitsi | $5-10 | 10 min | ‚úÖ Good |
| BBB on DigitalOcean | $40 | 30 min | ‚ö†Ô∏è Overkill |
| BBB Hosted | $100+ | 10 min | ‚ùå Too expensive |

## What I Recommend:

1. **Use public Jitsi** (free, instant)
2. Keep your frontend on **Vercel** (online.rv2class.com)
3. All existing student URLs keep working
4. **Total cost: $0/month**

Then if you grow and need BBB features (breakout rooms, etc.), upgrade later!

Would you like me to:
- A) Set up free Jitsi integration (RECOMMENDED)
- B) Deploy self-hosted Jitsi to Fly.io
- C) Still go with BBB (but it'll cost $40+/month minimum)
