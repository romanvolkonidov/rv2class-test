# Homework Visibility Update

## Change Summary
Removed the date filter that was hiding homework assignments given before October 7, 2025.

## What Changed

### Previous Behavior
- Only homework assigned **on or after October 7, 2025** was displayed
- Earlier homework was filtered out using a cutoff date check
- This was implemented with: `const cutoffDate = new Date('2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z');`

### New Behavior
- **ALL homework assignments** are now visible
- No date filtering applied
- Homework is still sorted by newest first (latest assigned on top)

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `app/student/[id]/homework/student-homework.tsx`

### Code Changes
**Removed:**
```typescript
// Filter: Only show homework assigned from October 7, 2025 onwards
const cutoffDate = new Date('2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z');
const filteredAssignments = assignmentsData.filter(assignment => {
  if (!assignment.assignedAt) return true;
  // ... date parsing and comparison logic
  return assignedDate >= cutoffDate;
});
```

**Kept:**
- Sorting logic remains unchanged (newest first)
- All other functionality intact (reports, question counts, completion tracking)

### Impact
- Students can now see their complete homework history
- No change to homework completion functionality
- No change to grading or reporting
- Sorting still works (newest assignments appear first)

## User Experience
- Students visiting their homework page will now see ALL assigned homework
- Older assignments will appear below newer ones (sorted by date)
- Complete homework history is accessible
- No functional changes to taking quizzes or viewing results
