# Homework Features - Summary

## Current Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

1. **Screenshare Annotation Button** - Fixed detection with multiple methods
2. **Whiteboard Synchronization** - Now broadcasts to all students  
3. **Feedback Questions** - Updated to Russian questions
4. **Homework Scoring Bug** - Fixed case-sensitive comparison (was causing 0/4 for correct answers)

## New Feature Request üéØ

### Student Side:
- **Red badge** on "–î–æ–º–∞—à–Ω–∏–µ –∑–∞–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è" button showing uncompleted homework count

### Teacher Side:
- **New "Homeworks" button** on `/students` page
- Button has **badge** showing unseen homework submissions
- Clicking opens new page showing **all completed homeworks**:
  - Student name for each submission
  - Score and date
  - Latest on top
  - Ability to mark as "seen"

## Why This Is a Bigger Task

This requires:
1. **Database schema changes** - Add `seenByTeacher: boolean` field to homework reports
2. **New Firebase functions** (3-4 new functions in lib/firebase.ts)
3. **New teacher page** (`/app/teacher/homeworks/page.tsx` - ~300-400 lines)
4. **Two UI updates** (student welcome + teacher students page)
5. **Real-time count updates** when homeworks are completed/viewed

## Estimated Implementation Time

- Database functions: 30 min
- Student badge: 15 min  
- Teacher homeworks page: 1-2 hours (complex UI with filtering, sorting, marking seen)
- Teacher badge: 20 min
- Testing: 30 min

**Total: ~3-4 hours of development**

## Would You Like Me To:

A) **Implement it now** - I'll create all the files and make all changes
B) **Just the student badge** - Quick win, shows uncompleted count
C) **Just the teacher view** - Full teacher page without the badge
D) **Detailed plan only** - You implement later

Let me know which approach you prefer!

## Quick Wins I Can Do Right Now (15 min each):

1. ‚úÖ Remove the debug info from homework page (Score: X% | CA: X | TQ: X)
2. ‚úÖ Add student badge to homework button
3. ‚úÖ Add basic teacher homeworks button (link to new page)

The full teacher homework management system is the big piece that needs careful design.
