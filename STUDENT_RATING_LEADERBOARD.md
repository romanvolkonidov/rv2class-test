# Student Rating Leaderboard Implementation

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive leaderboard system that shows ALL students' ratings when clicking "–ü–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ" button on a student's page.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Firebase Function (`lib/firebase.ts`)

Added `fetchAllStudentRatings()` function:
- **Purpose**: Fetch ratings for ALL students to enable comparison
- **Endpoint**: Uses `calculateStudentRatings` Cloud Function (not `getStudentRatings`)
- **URL**: `https://calculatestudentratings-35666ugduq-uc.a.run.app`
- **Features**:
  - Filters out students excluded from rating
  - Recalculates ranks after filtering
  - Returns array of all students with their ratings
  - Includes completion rates and percentages

### 2. Rating Display Update (`app/student/[id]/student-welcome.tsx`)

#### Changed Rating Display Format:
**Before**: Showed rating as `X.X / 10` (0-10 scale)
**After**: Shows rating as `XX.X%` (percentage from common rating)

This change ensures the displayed rating matches the percentage used in the actual rating calculation system.

#### Updated "–ü–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ" Button:
- Now fetches ALL student ratings when clicked
- Shows a full leaderboard with all students
- Highlights current student's position
- Shows medals (ü•áü•àü•â) for top 3 students

### 3. New Leaderboard Modal

The modal now displays:
- **Title**: "–†–µ–π—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ –≤—Å–µ—Ö —É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤" (All Students Ratings)
- **Leaderboard**: Shows all students ranked by performance
- **For each student**:
  - Rank (with medals for top 3)
  - Student name
  - Percentage rating (XX.X%)
  - Completed homework count
  - Score out of 10
  - "–≠—Ç–æ —Ç—ã!" badge for current student
- **Visual highlights**:
  - Current student row has amber/yellow gradient background
  - Top 3 get medal emojis (ü•áü•àü•â)
  - Loading state while fetching data

## User Experience

### Student View:
1. **On student page**: See rating as percentage (e.g., "87.5%")
2. **Click "–ü–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ"**: Modal opens showing full leaderboard
3. **View leaderboard**: See all students ranked by performance
4. **Find yourself**: Your row is highlighted in amber/yellow
5. **Compare**: See how you stack up against classmates
6. **Close**: Click "–ó–∞–∫—Ä—ã—Ç—å" to close modal

## Technical Details

### Cloud Function Used:
- **Name**: `calculateStudentRatings`
- **URL**: `https://calculatestudentratings-35666ugduq-uc.a.run.app`
- **Purpose**: Calculate and return ratings for ALL students
- **Optional parameter**: `tutorKey` (e.g., "roman", "violet")

### Data Flow:
1. Student clicks "–ü–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ"
2. `handleShowRatingDetails()` is triggered
3. Checks if ratings already loaded (cached)
4. If not, calls `fetchAllStudentRatings(teacherKey)`
5. Function fetches from Cloud Function
6. Filters excluded students
7. Recalculates ranks
8. Returns sorted array
9. Modal displays leaderboard

### Data Structure:
```typescript
{
  studentId: string;
  studentName: string;
  rank: number;
  overallRating: number;        // 0-10 scale
  averagePercentage: number;    // 0-100 scale (displayed)
  completedHomeworks: number;
  totalAssigned: number;
  completionRate: number;       // 0-100 percentage
}
```
