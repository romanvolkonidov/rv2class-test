   - Queries homework submissions
   - Tracks teacher-student relationships

2. **Unread Homework Badge**
   - Orange circular badge on Homeworks button
   - Shows count of unread submissions
   - Updates when teacher logs in
   - Only shows if count > 0

3. **Real-time Count Loading**
   - `loadUnreadCount()` function
   - Queries `teacherViewed` collection
   - Counts submissions not yet viewed
   - Supports shared teachers (SHARED_TEACHER_EMAILS)

4. **Badge Styling**
   - Position: Top-right corner of Homeworks button
   - Size: 28px × 28px circle
   - Color: Red (#e04757)
   - Border: 2px white border to contrast with button
   - Shadow: Subtle drop shadow

#### New State:
```typescript
const [unreadCount, setUnreadCount] = useState(0);
```

#### New Function:
```typescript
const loadUnreadCount = async (teacherEmail: string) => {
    // 1. Get viewed submissions from teacherViewed collection
    // 2. Get list of students for this teacher
    // 3. Query all homework submissions for those students
    // 4. Count submissions not in viewed list
    // 5. Update badge count
}
```

#### Badge Component:
```tsx
{unreadCount > 0 && (
    <span className={classes.homeworkBadge}>{unreadCount}</span>
)}
```

2. Join a meeting
3. Check watermark in left corner - should be **4x bigger**

### To Test Unread Badge:
1. Refresh browser
2. Sign in as teacher
3. Check Homeworks button - should show orange badge with count
4. Badge appears in top-right corner of button

### Expected Behavior:
```

User Signs In
    ↓
loadUnreadCount() Runs
    ↓
Queries Firestore:
  - Get viewedSubmissions for this teacher

  - Count unviewed submissions
    ↓
Update Badge: {unreadCount}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Remaining for Full React Migration:

1. **Students Management Page**
   - Create `StudentsPage.tsx`
   - Replace `students.html`

2. **Teacher Homeworks Review Page**
   - Create `TeacherHomeworksPage.tsx`
   - Replace `teacher-homeworks.html`

3. **Auth Page**
   - Create `AuthPage.tsx`
   - Replace `auth-page.html`

4. **React Router**
   - Setup routing for all pages
   - Remove HTML redirects

### Priority:
- **High**: StudentsPage (most used)
- **Medium**: TeacherHomeworksPage
- **Low**: AuthPage (current works fine)

---

## 📝 Summary

**Completed Today**:
1. ✅ Logo is now **4x bigger** (284px × 128px)
2. ✅ React dashboard has **unread homework badge**
3. ✅ Full Firestore integration in React
4. ✅ Feature parity with HTML dashboard

**What Works Now**:
- Teacher signs in → Dashboard loads → Badge shows unread count
- Clicking Homeworks → Goes to review page (still HTML)
- Logo displays at correct size in meetings

**Ready for Production**: Yes, with caveat that Students and Homeworks pages are still HTML (but that's fine for now)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Shared Teachers:
Edit line ~199 in `TeacherAuthPage.tsx`:
```typescript
const SHARED_TEACHER_EMAILS = ['romanvolkonidov@gmail.com'];
```

Add more emails to give teachers access to shared student collection.

### Firebase Config:
All Firebase configs are in the component (lines ~252, ~279, ~327).
Consider extracting to a config file for easier management.

- ✅ Large, prominent logo (4x original size)
