# Quick Fix Summary - Screen Share White Screen

## What Was Wrong
**The video element was using `object-cover` which crops content**, causing screen shares to show blank/white areas. Combined with missing `.play()` call and no black background.

## What Was Fixed

### File 1: `/components/CustomControlBar.tsx`
- Simplified screen share to use LiveKit's built-in method (no complex constraints)

### File 2: `/components/CustomVideoConference.tsx` ⭐ **MAIN FIX**
- Changed `object-cover` → `object-contain` for screen shares (shows full content)
- Added explicit `videoEl.play()` to force playback
- Added black background for screen shares
- Disabled mirroring for screen shares
- Added logging for debugging

## Test It Now
1. Start screen share
2. Select a browser tab
3. Content should now be visible (not white!)

## The Key Change
```typescript
// Before (caused white screen):
<video className="object-cover" />  // Crops content

// After (shows content):
<video className={isScreenShare ? "object-contain" : "object-cover"} />
```

This single change makes screen shares display properly!
