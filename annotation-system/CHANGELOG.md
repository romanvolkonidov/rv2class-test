## Known Limitations

1. **Performance**: Large number of concurrent users drawing simultaneously may impact performance
2. **Persistence**: Annotations are not saved to a database by default
3. **Export**: No built-in export to image/PDF (would require additional implementation)
4. **Shapes**: Limited to rectangle and circle (no polygon, arrow, etc.)
5. **Layers**: No layer management (all annotations on same z-level)
6. **Selection**: Can only select text, not other shapes
7. **History**: Undo/redo only works for local user's actions
