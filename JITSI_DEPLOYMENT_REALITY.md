# Jitsi Deployment Reality Check ⚠️

## The Challenge

You want to deploy self-hosted Jitsi on Fly.io for custom features. Here's what you need to know:

## Full Jitsi Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Jitsi Meet (Complete Stack)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Web Interface (nginx + React app)              │
│  2. Prosody (XMPP signaling server)                │
│  3. Jicofo (Conference focus/coordinator)          │
│  4. JVB (Video bridge - routes media)              │
│  5. Jibri (Recording - optional)                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Each service needs its own Fly.io app = $$$**

## Cost Reality

### Option 1: Full Jitsi on Fly.io
- 4-5 separate Fly apps (web, prosody, jicofo, jvb, jibri)
- **Cost**: $40-80/month
- **Complexity**: High (inter-service networking)
- **Maintenance**: Significant

### Option 2: Jitsi on Single Vultr VPS ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
- All services on one machine
- **Cost**: $12-24/month
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Maintenance**: Moderate
- **Performance**: Better (no network hops)

### Option 3: Keep Using meet.jit.si ✅ **BEST FOR YOU**
- **Cost**: $0/month
- **Complexity**: Zero
- **Maintenance**: None
- **Performance**: Excellent (global CDN)

## Your Use Case Analysis

**Current situation:**
- 2 teachers
- Mostly 1-on-1 lessons
- Rarely 2 students at once
- ~2-4 concurrent users max

**Do you need self-hosted Jitsi?**
- ❌ For scale: No (meet.jit.si handles millions)
- ❌ For performance: No (their CDN is faster)
- ✅ For custom branding: Maybe (but is it worth $144-960/year?)
- ✅ For recordings control: Yes (if you need this)
- ✅ For custom features: Yes (if you really need them)

## Recommendations

### Immediate: Stick with meet.jit.si
Your current setup with `meet.jit.si` is perfect because:
- ✅ FREE
- ✅ Global edge locations
- ✅ Auto-scaling
- ✅ Battle-tested
- ✅ Perfect for 2 teachers

### Near Future: If You Need Custom Features

#### Option A: 8x8 Video Meetings (Jitsi's Commercial Service)
- **URL**: https://8x8.vc
- **Cost**: ~$15-30/month
- **Features**: 
  - Custom branding
  - Recording & storage
  - Analytics
  - Priority support
  - Same Jitsi tech, managed
- **Best if**: You want custom features without ops

#### Option B: Jitsi on Vultr VPS
- **Cost**: $12-24/month VPS
- **Setup**: One-time (2-3 hours)
- **Features**: Full control, all features
- **Best if**: You're technical and want full control

### When You Scale: Enterprise Solutions

When you reach 10+ teachers or 50+ daily students:
- Consider Jitsi on Kubernetes
- Or enterprise Jitsi hosting
- Or build your own infrastructure

## If You Still Want Fly.io Jitsi...

I can help, but be aware:

**Realistic Fly.io Approach:**
1. Deploy full Jitsi stack on Vultr ($12/month)
2. Use Fly.io only for edge caching/proxy
3. Coturn on Vultr for TURN ($6/month)
4. Total: ~$18/month

**vs. meet.jit.si:**
- Total: $0/month
- Works just as well for your scale

## My Strong Recommendation

**For your current needs (2 teachers, 1-on-1):**

1. **Keep using meet.jit.si** (what you have now)
   - It's perfect for your scale
   - Save $216-1000/year
   - Zero maintenance

2. **When you need custom features:**
   - Try 8x8 Video Meetings first ($15-30/month)
   - If that doesn't work, deploy on Vultr ($12-24/month)

3. **Deploy your Coturn on Vultr anyway**
   - It helps BBB too
   - Good backup for connectivity
   - Only $6/month
   - Use the script: `./setup-coturn-vultr.sh`

## What We Should Do Now

I recommend:

### Plan A: Keep Current Setup (FREE) ✅
1. Keep JitsiRoom.tsx using `meet.jit.si`
2. Deploy Coturn on Vultr (helps BBB + backup for Jitsi)
3. Deploy your frontend updates to Vercel
4. Done! Save $216+/year

### Plan B: Deploy Coturn Only
1. Run `./setup-coturn-vultr.sh` on new Vultr server
2. Update JitsiRoom.tsx with Coturn IP
3. Deploy frontend to Vercel
4. Still use meet.jit.si, just with your TURN server
5. Cost: $6/month for Coturn

### Plan C: Full Jitsi on Vultr (Later)
When you actually need custom features:
1. Create Vultr VPS ($12-24/month)
2. Use Jitsi's quick-install script
3. Point domain to it
4. Update frontend
5. Cost: $18-30/month total

## Decision Time

What would you like to do?

**A)** Keep meet.jit.si (FREE, recommended)
**B)** Deploy Coturn only ($6/month, helps both BBB & Jitsi)
**C)** Full Jitsi on Vultr ($18-30/month, when you need features)
**D)** Force Jitsi on Fly.io anyway ($40-80/month, not recommended)

## Quick Cost Comparison Table

| Solution | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Setup Time | Maintenance |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| meet.jit.si (current) | $0 | $0 | Done ✅ | None |
| + Coturn on Vultr | $6 | $72 | 30 min | Low |
| 8x8 Video Meetings | $15-30 | $180-360 | 10 min | None |
| Jitsi on Vultr | $18-30 | $216-360 | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| Jitsi on Fly.io | $40-80 | $480-960 | 4-6 hours | High |

**Savings by sticking with meet.jit.si: $216-960/year!** 💰
