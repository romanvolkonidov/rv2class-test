# Room Separation Bug Fix

## The Problem üêõ

**Symptom**: Students sometimes join with the correct 6-digit code but end up in a separate room from the teacher. Requires browser refresh to fix.

**Root Cause**: Firestore caching race condition

## Technical Details

When a student joins a lesson, the flow is:
1. Teacher creates session ‚Üí stores in `activeSessions/{tutorKey}` with `roomName` like `roman-123456`
2. Student clicks join ‚Üí reads `activeSessions/{tutorKey}`
3. Teacher approves ‚Üí student reads `activeSessions/{tutorKey}` again
4. Student navigates to `/room?room=...`

### The Bug

**Firestore was using cached data** from step 2 when fetching in step 3. If the teacher had restarted their session or if there was any timing issue, the student would get stale room information from Firestore's local cache instead of the current active room.

### Why "Refresh" Fixed It

When the student refreshed their browser:
- Browser cache was cleared
- Firestore cache was invalidated
- Fresh data was fetched from the server
- Student joined the correct, current room

## The Fix ‚úÖ

### 1. Fixed Firestore Caching (CRITICAL)
**File**: `app/[tutor]/join-client.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
const sessionDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "activeSessions", tutorKey));
```

To:
```typescript
const sessionDoc = await getDocFromServer(doc(db, "activeSessions", tutorKey));
```

This **bypasses Firestore's cache** and always fetches the latest data directly from the server, ensuring students always get the current active room name.

### 2. Fixed URL Parameter Inconsistency
**File**: `app/room/page.tsx`

Changed from:
```typescript
const sessionCode = searchParams?.get("code") || "";
```

To:
```typescript
const sessionCode = searchParams?.get("sessionCode") || searchParams?.get("code") || "";
```

This ensures compatibility with URLs that send `sessionCode` parameter (as `join-client.tsx` does).

### 3. Added Comprehensive Logging

Added detailed console logging throughout the flow:

**Teacher side** (`app/page.tsx`):
- Logs session creation with exact room name format
- Verifies room name structure: `{teacherKey}-{sessionCode}`

**Student side** (`app/[tutor]/join-client.tsx`):
- Logs when fetching session data from server (not cache)
- Logs exact room name being joined
- Validates room name format matches expected pattern
- Alerts if room name mismatch detected

**Room page** (`app/room/page.tsx`):
- Logs exact parameters used to join
- Shows room name, user name, tutor status, and session code

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Teacher**: Start a lesson as Roman or Violet
   - Check console: Should see `üÜï Creating NEW session for {teacher}` with roomName like `roman-123456`

2. **Student**: Try to join at `https://your-domain/roman` (or `/violet`)
   - Enter name and click join
   - Check console: Should see `üîç Fetching CURRENT session data for roman from server...`
   - Should see `‚úÖ Got session data from server:` with matching roomName

3. **Both**: Once student is approved
   - Teacher console: Should show participant joined
   - Student console: Should show `üöÄ Navigating student to room:` with exact URL
   - **Both should be in room with same name** like `roman-123456`

4. **Verify no separation**:
   - Both users should see each other immediately
   - Audio/video should connect
   - No refresh should be needed

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Join ‚úÖ
- Teacher starts lesson ‚Üí creates `roman-123456`
- Student joins ‚Üí fetches `roman-123456` from server
- Both join same room ‚úÖ

### Scenario 2: Teacher Restarts (Previously Buggy) ‚úÖ
- Teacher starts lesson ‚Üí creates `roman-123456`
- Student opens join page (caches `roman-123456`)
- Teacher ends and restarts ‚Üí creates `roman-789012`
- Student tries to join ‚Üí now fetches `roman-789012` from server (not cache!) ‚úÖ
- Both join same room ‚úÖ

### Scenario 3: Student Refreshes ‚úÖ
- Already works, now works even better with explicit logging

## Prevention

The fix ensures:
1. **Always fresh data**: `getDocFromServer` bypasses all caching
2. **Validation**: Room name format is verified before joining
3. **Debugging**: Extensive logging helps track any future issues
4. **Compatibility**: URL parameters are flexible

## Files Changed

1. `app/[tutor]/join-client.tsx` - Critical caching fix + logging
2. `app/page.tsx` - Enhanced session creation logging
3. `app/room/page.tsx` - Fixed parameter name + enhanced logging

## Impact

- ‚úÖ Students always join the correct room on first try
- ‚úÖ No more "refresh to fix" workaround needed
- ‚úÖ Clear console logs for debugging
- ‚úÖ Better error messages if something goes wrong
