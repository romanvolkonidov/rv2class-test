## Technical Implementation

### State Management:
```typescript
const [expandedGroups, setExpandedGroups] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```
Tracks which groups are currently expanded.

### Key Functions:

#### `toggleGroupExpanded(color: string)`
Expands/collapses a color group.

#### `removeAllFromGroup(color: string)`
Removes all students from a specific color group with confirmation.

```typescript
const removeAllFromGroup = async (color: string) => {
  if (!confirm(`Remove all students from the ${color} group?`)) return;
  
  const studentsInGroup = students.filter(s => s.tag === color);
  await Promise.all(
    studentsInGroup.map(student => updateStudentTag(student.id, null))
  );
  await loadStudents();
};
```

#### `handleTagChange(studentId: string, newTag: string | null)`
Updates or removes a student's color tag.
