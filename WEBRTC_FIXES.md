# WebRTC Fixes Applied - October 7, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Echo Problem
**Problem**: Loud echo appearing during meetings, persisting even after page refresh

**Root Causes**:
- Preview audio/video streams not being stopped before joining the room
- Lack of proper echo cancellation constraints
- Local audio being played back through speakers

**Solutions Applied**:
- **student-welcome.tsx**: Added code to stop all preview streams (microphone and camera) before joining the room to prevent duplicate audio sources
- **student-welcome.tsx**: Added proper audio constraints with echo cancellation, noise suppression, and auto gain control:
  ```typescript
  audio: {
    echoCancellation: true,
    noiseSuppression: true,
    autoGainControl: true,
    sampleRate: 48000,
  }
  ```
- **CustomVideoConference.tsx**: Ensured local participant's audio is NEVER played back through speakers (only remote participants' audio is played)
- **room/page.tsx**: Added global audio capture defaults with echo cancellation for all participants

### 2. ‚úÖ Audio Not Heard Until Refresh
**Problem**: Students sometimes couldn't hear the teacher until they refreshed the page

**Root Cause**: Connection state issues and lack of automatic recovery

**Solutions Applied**:
- **room/page.tsx**: Added comprehensive connection state monitoring
- Automatic reconnection with visual feedback (up to 3 attempts)
- Connection state change notifications in Russian:
  - üîÑ "–ü–µ—Ä–µ–ø–æ–¥–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ..." (Reconnecting...)
  - ‚úÖ "–°–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ!" (Connection restored!)
  - ‚ùå "–ù–µ —É–¥–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å —Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ" (Failed to restore connection)

### 3. ‚úÖ Screen Share Clarity Issues
**Problem**: Shared screen text unclear and quality fluctuating (improving then degrading)

**Root Causes**:
- Low bitrate (3 Mbps) insufficient for clear text
- No adaptive quality management
- Lack of high-resolution settings

**Solutions Applied**:
- **room/page.tsx**: Increased screen share bitrate from 3 Mbps to **15 Mbps** for Zoom/Teams-level quality
- **room/page.tsx**: Added proper screen share encoding settings
- **CustomControlBar.tsx**: Updated screen share request to prioritize text clarity
- The 15 Mbps bitrate matches Zoom and Teams for maximum text sharpness
- LiveKit's adaptive bitrate will automatically adjust based on network conditions

## Technical Details

### Echo Prevention Flow:
1. Student requests microphone permission ‚Üí Gets stream with echo cancellation
2. Student requests camera permission ‚Üí Gets stream with proper settings
3. **CRITICAL**: Before joining room ‚Üí All preview streams are stopped
4. Room creates fresh streams with proper WebRTC echo cancellation
5. Local audio is never played back through speakers

### Connection Recovery Flow:
1. Detect connection state change (reconnecting/disconnected)
2. Show visual notification to user
3. Attempt reconnection (up to 3 times)
4. Show success or failure notification
5. LiveKit handles ICE restart automatically

### Screen Share Quality:
- **Bitrate**: 15 Mbps (Zoom/Teams quality - increased from 3 Mbps)
- **Frame Rate**: 30 fps
- **Echo Cancellation**: Disabled for screen audio (prevents audio quality issues)
- **Adaptive**: Automatically adjusts based on network conditions

## Files Modified:
1. `/app/student/[id]/student-welcome.tsx` - Echo prevention, proper media constraints
2. `/app/room/page.tsx` - Screen share quality, connection monitoring, audio defaults
3. `/components/CustomVideoConference.tsx` - Local audio muting, proper track handling
4. `/components/CustomControlBar.tsx` - High-quality screen share requests

## Testing Recommendations:

### Echo Testing:
1. Join a room with 2 participants
2. Both turn on microphones
3. Verify no echo or feedback loop
4. Test with preview enabled then joining (echo should not occur)

### Connection Testing:
1. Join a room
2. Temporarily disable network (airplane mode for 5 seconds)
3. Re-enable network
4. Verify automatic reconnection with notifications

### Screen Share Quality:
1. Share screen with text-heavy content (code, documents)
2. Verify text is crisp and readable
3. Test with varying network conditions
4. Monitor quality over 5-10 minutes

## Additional Notes:

- All error messages are in Russian for better user experience
- Console logging added for debugging (look for üõë, üé§, üìπ, üîå, üìä emojis)
- Preview streams are properly cleaned up on component unmount
- Connection state changes trigger user-friendly notifications

## Prevention for Future:

1. **Always stop preview streams** before joining a room
2. **Always use echo cancellation** in audio constraints
3. **Never play local audio** back through speakers
4. **Monitor connection state** and provide user feedback
5. **Use adequate bitrate** for screen sharing (5+ Mbps for text)
