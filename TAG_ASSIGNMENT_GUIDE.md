# How to Use the Color Tag System

## Step 1: Assign Tags to Students

1. Go to `/students` page
2. Find any student in the list
3. Look for the "Color Tag:" section under their name
4. Click on any color circle to assign that tag
5. Click the same color again (or the Ã— button) to remove the tag

## Step 2: Share Group Links

Once students have tags assigned:

1. The "Group Links (Tag-based)" section appears at the top of `/students` page
2. Each color group shows:
   - Color name
   - Number of students
   - Copy button (copies link to clipboard)
   - Open button (opens in new tab)

## Step 3: Students Use the Link

When students visit a tag link (e.g., `/student/tag/blue`):

1. They see a page titled "Ð’Ñ‹Ð±ÐµÑ€Ð¸Ñ‚Ðµ ÑƒÑ‡ÐµÐ½Ð¸ÐºÐ°" (Choose Student)
2. All students with that tag appear as colored buttons
3. Each button shows:
   - Student name
   - Teacher name
   - Color dot
4. Student clicks their name â†’ redirected to their personal welcome page
