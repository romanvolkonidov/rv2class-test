# Annotation System Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated the annotation system from the `annotation-system` folder into the main JitsiRoom component. Users can now toggle annotation mode to draw and collaborate on the video call interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Copied AnnotationOverlay Component
- **File**: `components/AnnotationOverlay.tsx`
- Copied from `annotation-system/components/AnnotationOverlay.tsx`
- Full-featured annotation overlay with drawing tools

### 2. Updated JitsiRoom Component
- **File**: `components/JitsiRoom.tsx`

#### New Imports:
```tsx
import { Pencil } from "lucide-react";
import AnnotationOverlay from "@/components/AnnotationOverlay";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
```

#### New State:
```tsx
const [showAnnotations, setShowAnnotations] = useState(false);
```

#### New UI Elements:
1. **Annotation Toggle Button** - Positioned top-right of the screen
   - Shows "Show Annotations" when inactive (secondary style)
   - Shows "Hide Annotations" when active (primary blue style)
   - Includes pencil icon
   - Only visible after Jitsi loads (not during loading)

2. **Annotation Overlay** - Conditionally rendered when `showAnnotations` is true
   - Full-screen overlay for annotations
   - Respects `isTutor` prop for permissions
   - Can be closed via button or overlay's close button

## Features Available

### Drawing Tools:
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Pencil** - Freehand drawing

- ‚¨ú **Rectangle** - Draw rectangles
- ‚≠ï **Circle** - Draw circles
- üî§ **Text** - Add text annotations
- üëÜ **Pointer** - Select and edit text

### Collaboration Features:
- Real-time synchronization (via LiveKit data channel)
- Teacher can clear all, teacher's, or students' annotations
- Students can annotate on shared content
- Edit protection (users can only edit their own text, teachers can edit all)

### UI Features:
- Draggable toolbar
- Collapsible toolbar (starts minimized)
- Color picker (10 colors)
- Line width adjustment (1-20px)
- Font size adjustment (12-72px)
- Undo/Redo support
- Touch-friendly interface

## Usage

### For Teachers (Tutors):
1. Join the Jitsi meeting
2. Click "Show Annotations" button in the top-right
3. Use the annotation tools to draw on the screen
4. Can clear all annotations or specific user's annotations
5. Can edit any text annotations
6. Click "Hide Annotations" to close

### For Students:
1. Join the Jitsi meeting
2. Click "Show Annotations" button in the top-right
3. Can draw and add annotations
4. Can only edit their own text annotations
5. Click "Hide Annotations" to close

## Technical Notes

### Z-Index Layers:
- Jitsi container: z-0 (base)
- Annotation button: z-50
- Annotation overlay: z-40 (set in AnnotationOverlay component)
- Loading screen: z-10

### Button Styling:
- Active state: Blue (bg-blue-600)
- Inactive state: White/Gray (bg-white)
- Shadow and smooth transitions
- Responsive size (lg)

### Integration Points:
- The annotation overlay captures the Jitsi video element for annotations
- Works independently of Jitsi's internal toolbar
- No modifications to Jitsi's configuration needed

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Auto-show annotations when screen sharing starts
2. Save annotation history
3. Export annotations as images
4. Sync annotations via Jitsi's data channels instead of LiveKit
5. Add more drawing tools (arrows, highlights, etc.)
6. Add keyboard shortcuts
7. Mobile-optimized controls

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `/components/JitsiRoom.tsx` - Added annotation toggle and integration
2. ‚úÖ `/components/AnnotationOverlay.tsx` - Copied annotation component

## Dependencies

Existing dependencies used:
- `lucide-react` - Pencil icon
- `@/components/ui/button` - UI button component
- `@/lib/utils` - cn utility function

No new dependencies required! üéâ
