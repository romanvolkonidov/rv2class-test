# Screen Share White Screen Fix - October 7, 2025 (FINAL)

## Problem
When selecting a **tab** or **window** for screen sharing, only white/blank space was displayed instead of the actual content. The browser's screen picker worked, but the shared content appeared as a blank white screen on the receiving end.

## Root Causes (Two Issues Found)

### Issue 1: Overly Complex Capture Constraints
The screen share implementation used **manual `getDisplayMedia()` with experimental constraints** that conflict with browser compositor/rendering:
- `selfBrowserSurface: "exclude"` - Experimental, poor browser support
- `surfaceSwitching: "include"` - Can cause rendering conflicts  
- `systemAudio: "include"` - Not supported in all browsers
- Complex multi-step manual track publishing

### Issue 2: Video Element Rendering Problems ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**
The `ParticipantView` component had issues rendering screen share content:
- ‚ùå Using `object-cover` (crops content) instead of `object-contain` (fits content)
- ‚ùå No explicit `.play()` call on video element (some browsers need this)
- ‚ùå Missing black background (white backgrounds showed through)
- ‚ùå Mirror transform applied to screen share (flipped content)
- ‚ùå Insufficient logging to diagnose playback issues

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Simplified Screen Share Capture
**Switched to LiveKit's built-in `setScreenShareEnabled()`** with minimal constraints:

```typescript
// NEW APPROACH - Works reliably:
await localParticipant.setScreenShareEnabled(true, {
  audio: true,  // Allow audio if user selects it
  // No complex constraints that break tab/window capture
});
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Uses only stable, well-supported browser APIs
- ‚úÖ Handles browser quirks automatically
- ‚úÖ Works across Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- ‚úÖ Quality settings from room config still apply

### Fix 2: Fixed Video Element Rendering ‚≠ê **CRITICAL FIX**
Updated `ParticipantView` to properly handle screen share content:

**Changes made:**
1. **Detect screen share tracks**: `const isScreenShare = trackRef?.source === Track.Source.ScreenShare`
2. **Use `object-contain`** instead of `object-cover` for screen shares (preserves aspect ratio, shows full content)
3. **Explicit `.play()` call**: Force video playback after attachment
4. **Black background**: Solid black behind screen share content
5. **No mirroring**: Don't flip screen share content
6. **Better logging**: Track attachment/detachment debugging

```typescript
// Key changes in video element:
<video
  className={cn(
    isScreenShare ? "object-contain" : "object-cover",  // ‚Üê CRITICAL
    isLocal && !isScreenShare && "scale-x-[-1]"        // ‚Üê Don't flip screen share
  )}
  style={isScreenShare ? { backgroundColor: '#000' } : undefined}  // ‚Üê Black background
/>
```

```typescript
// Force playback after attaching:
track.attach(videoEl);
videoEl.play().catch(err => {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Video autoplay failed:', err);
});
```

## Why These Fixes Work

### Capture Side:
- **Stability**: LiveKit's method is battle-tested across browsers
- **Compatibility**: No experimental APIs that fail in certain browsers
- **Reliability**: Automatic fallbacks for edge cases

### Rendering Side: ‚≠ê **The Real Fix**
- **`object-contain`**: Shows the ENTIRE screen share without cropping
- **Explicit play()**: Ensures video starts playing immediately
- **Black background**: Proper contrast, no white showing through
- **No mirroring**: Screen share content appears correctly oriented
- **Enhanced logging**: Easier to diagnose any remaining issues

## Quality Settings (Still Applied)
From room configuration (`/app/room/page.tsx`):
- ‚úÖ **10 Mbps bitrate** for ultra-sharp text
- ‚úÖ **VP9 codec** with VP8 fallback
- ‚úÖ **High resolution** (up to 1440p based on display)
- ‚úÖ **30fps** frame rate
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive quality** based on network

## Files Modified

### 1. `/components/CustomControlBar.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Removed complex manual `getDisplayMedia()` implementation
- ‚úÖ Switched to simple `localParticipant.setScreenShareEnabled()`
- ‚úÖ Removed experimental API constraints
- ‚úÖ Added two-level fallback strategy

### 2. `/components/CustomVideoConference.tsx` ‚≠ê **CRITICAL FILE**
- ‚úÖ Added screen share detection: `isScreenShare` variable
- ‚úÖ Changed `object-cover` ‚Üí `object-contain` for screen shares
- ‚úÖ Added explicit `videoEl.play()` call after track attachment
- ‚úÖ Added black background for screen share content
- ‚úÖ Disabled mirroring for screen share tracks
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging for video track attachment
- ‚úÖ Hide name overlay for screen shares (maximize space)
- ‚úÖ Hide camera placeholder for screen shares

## Testing Results
After these fixes, screen sharing works correctly:
- ‚úÖ **Browser Tab** - Full content visible (not white/blank)
- ‚úÖ **Application Window** - Window content displays properly
- ‚úÖ **Full Monitor** - Entire screen shares correctly
- ‚úÖ **Proper Aspect Ratio** - No cropping or distortion
- ‚úÖ **Text Clarity** - Sharp and readable with 10 Mbps bitrate
- ‚úÖ **Audio** - Tab/system audio when available

## Verification Steps
1. Start a session and click screen share
2. Select a **browser tab** (like learn.eltngl.com)
3. ‚úÖ Verify actual content appears (NOT white/blank)
4. ‚úÖ Check that content is not cropped or mirrored
5. ‚úÖ Verify text is clear and readable
6. Test with **window** and **full screen** options too

## Console Logs to Watch For
When screen sharing works correctly, you'll see:
```
üñ•Ô∏è Starting screen share with simplified approach...
‚úÖ Screen share enabled successfully
üé• Attaching video track: { source: "screen_share", participant: "...", trackSid: "..." }
```

If you see any errors about video playback, that indicates browser autoplay restrictions.

## Key Lesson Learned
The white screen issue was **NOT** primarily about capture constraints - it was about **how the video element rendered the content**. Using `object-cover` (which crops and fills) instead of `object-contain` (which fits content) was causing the screen share to render incorrectly, often showing blank/white space. Combined with missing `.play()` call and improper backgrounds, this created the white screen effect.

**Both fixes were needed:**
1. Simplified capture (for reliability)
2. Fixed video rendering (for actual display) ‚≠ê **This was the main issue**
