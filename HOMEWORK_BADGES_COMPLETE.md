## Visual Design

- **Position**: Top-right corner of homework button
- **Size**: 28px circle
- **Shows**: Number of uncompleted homework

### Teacher Badge:
- **Color**: Red (`bg-red-500`)
- **Position**: Top-right corner of Homework card
- **Size**: 32px circle
- **Shows**: Number of unseen submissions

- **Ring Highlight**: Red ring around entire card for unseen items
- **Unseen Counter**: Large badge in header showing total new submissions

## Technical Details

### Badge Logic:

**Student Badge (Uncompleted):**
```typescript
// Count = Total Assignments - Completed Reports
const uncompletedCount = assignments.filter(a => 
  !completedIds.has(a.id)
).length;
```

**Teacher Badge (Unseen):**
```typescript
// Count = Reports where seenByTeacher is false or undefined
const unseenCount = reports.filter(report => 
  !report.seenByTeacher
).length;
```

### Auto-marking as Seen:
When teacher clicks "View Details" on any homework:
1. Function `markHomeworkAsSeen(reportId)` is called
2. Updates Firestore document: `seenByTeacher: true`
3. Local state updates to remove "NEW" badge
4. Badge counter decreases

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

4. **Notifications**: Email/push notifications for new homework
5. **Analytics**: Average scores, completion rates, trends
6. **Search**: Search by student name or homework topic
