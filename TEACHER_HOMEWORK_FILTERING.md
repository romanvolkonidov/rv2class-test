# Teacher-Specific Homework View Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Teacher Homework Page to ensure teachers only see homework from their own students, while Roman and Violet (admin teachers) can see shared students as well.

## Changes Made

### File: `TeacherHomeworkPage.tsx`

#### 1. **Teacher ID Detection** (Lines 555-577)
Added multiple methods to get the current teacher's ID:
- URL parameter: `?teacherId=xxx`
- localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('teacherId')`
- sessionStorage: `sessionStorage.getItem('teacherId')`
- Firebase Auth: Falls back to `firebaseAuth.currentUser.uid`

```typescript
let teacherId = params.get('teacherId') || 
               localStorage.getItem('teacherId') || 
               sessionStorage.getItem('teacherId');

// Try Firebase Auth if available
if (!teacherId && (window as any).firebaseAuth) {
    const auth = (window as any).firebaseAuth.getAuth();
    const user = auth.currentUser;
    if (user) {
        teacherId = user.uid;
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Teacher-Specific Student Loading** (Lines 579-600)
- Loads students from `teacherStudents` collection filtered by `teacherUid`
- Creates a Set of student IDs belonging to the teacher
- Creates a Map for quick student name lookup

```typescript
if (teacherId) {
    const teacherStudentsSnapshot = await getDocs(
        query(
            collection(db, 'teacherStudents'),
            where('teacherUid', '==', teacherId)
        )
    );
    
    teacherStudentsSnapshot.docs.forEach((doc: any) => {
        const studentData = doc.data();
        studentMap.set(doc.id, studentData.name || 'Unknown Student');
        teacherStudentIds.add(doc.id);
    });
}
```

#### 3. **Admin Teacher Support** (Lines 602-619)
Roman and Violet can also access the shared `students` collection:
- Checks if teacherId is in adminTeachers array
- Loads additional students from shared `students` collection
- Merges them with teacher-specific students

```typescript
const adminTeachers = ['ggWKiXIKlofbVfx7D6rq7REXRSJ3', 'violet-teacher-id'];
if (teacherId && adminTeachers.includes(teacherId)) {
    const sharedStudentsSnapshot = await getDocs(
        collection(db, 'students')
    );
    sharedStudentsSnapshot.docs.forEach((doc: any) => {
        if (!studentMap.has(doc.id)) {
            studentMap.set(doc.id, studentData.name || 'Unknown Student');
            teacherStudentIds.add(doc.id);
        }
    });
}
```

#### 4. **Homework Filtering** (Lines 621-651)
Filters homework reports to only show those from the teacher's students:

```typescript
for (const docSnap of reportsSnapshot.docs) {
    const data = docSnap.data();
    
    // Only include homework from teacher's students
    if (!teacherStudentIds.has(data.studentId)) {
        console.log('⏭️ Skipping homework from student not in teacher\'s list');
        continue;
    }
    
    // Add to homework list...
}
```

## Database Structure

### Collections Used:

1. **`teacherStudents`** - Teacher-specific students
   ```json
   {
       "id": "student123",
       "name": "Student Name",
       "teacherUid": "teacher-uid-here",
       "email": "student@email.com"
   }
   ```

2. **`students`** - Shared students (Roman & Violet only)
   ```json
   {
       "id": "student456",
       "name": "Shared Student",
       "email": "shared@email.com"
   }
   ```

3. **`telegramHomeworkReports`** - Homework submissions
   ```json
   {
       "studentId": "student123",
       "homeworkId": "hw001",
       "score": 85,
       "submittedAnswers": [...]
   }
   ```

## Teacher Access Flow

```
Teacher opens teacher-homework.html
    ↓
System detects teacherId from:
  - URL parameter
  - localStorage
  - sessionStorage  
  - Firebase Auth
    ↓
Load teacher's students from teacherStudents
(+ shared students if admin)
    ↓
Load ALL homework reports
    ↓
Filter to show only homework from teacher's students
    ↓
Display filtered homework list
```

## Admin Teacher IDs

Update these IDs in the code:
```typescript
const adminTeachers = [
    'ggWKiXIKlofbVfx7D6rq7REXRSJ3',  // Roman's UID
    'violet-teacher-id'               // Violet's UID (update this)
];
```

## How to Set Teacher ID

### Option 1: URL Parameter
```
teacher-homework.html?teacherId=ggWKiXIKlofbVfx7D6rq7REXRSJ3
```

### Option 2: localStorage (Recommended)
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('teacherId', 'teacher-uid-here');
```

### Option 3: Firebase Auth
Teacher logs in with Firebase Authentication, and the system automatically uses their UID.

## Testing

1. **As Regular Teacher:**
   - Should only see homework from students in `teacherStudents` with matching `teacherUid`

2. **As Admin Teacher (Roman/Violet):**
   - Should see homework from both:
     - Their students in `teacherStudents`
     - All students in shared `students` collection

3. **Without Teacher ID:**
   - System shows warning in console
   - Falls back to showing no homework (or all homework in admin mode)

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important:** This is client-side filtering only!

For production, you should:
1. Add Firebase Security Rules to restrict access
2. Implement server-side filtering
3. Use Firebase Auth properly to ensure teachers can only access their data

### Recommended Firebase Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /teacherStudents/{studentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     resource.data.teacherUid == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    match /telegramHomeworkReports/{reportId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      // Add more specific rules based on your requirements
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Violet's Teacher ID** in the adminTeachers array
2. **Add Authentication** to automatically set teacherId
3. **Test with Multiple Teachers** to ensure isolation
4. **Add Firebase Security Rules** for production
