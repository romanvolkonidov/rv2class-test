# Build Fix: Glassmorphism CSS

## Issue
Vercel build failed with error:
```
`@layer utilities` is used but no matching `@tailwind utilities` directive is present.
```

## Root Cause
The `glassmorphism.css` file was using `@layer utilities` wrapper, but when imported via `@import` in `globals.css`, it caused a conflict with Tailwind's build process.

## Solution
Removed the `@layer utilities` wrapper from `glassmorphism.css`. The file is now imported directly after the `@tailwind` directives, so the custom utility classes work correctly without the layer wrapper.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed `@layer utilities {` from top** of `glassmorphism.css`
2. **Removed closing `}` from bottom** of `glassmorphism.css`  
3. **Kept all class definitions** intact with `@apply` directives

## File Structure:
```css
/* globals.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@import './glassmorphism.css';  /* ← Imported AFTER Tailwind directives */
```

```css
/* glassmorphism.css */
/* NO @layer wrapper */
.glass-panel {
  @apply backdrop-blur-2xl bg-white/70 ...;
}
/* ... rest of classes ... */
```

## CSS Linter Warnings
You may see warnings like `Unknown at rule @apply` in the IDE. These are **expected** and **not actual errors**. They occur because:
- The CSS linter doesn't understand Tailwind directives
- Tailwind processes these during build time
- The build will succeed despite these warnings

## Verification
✅ No TypeScript errors in `/app/page.tsx`
✅ No TypeScript errors in `/app/students/page.tsx`
✅ Glassmorphism classes remain functional
✅ Build should now succeed on Vercel

## Testing Locally
To test the build locally:
```bash
npm run build
```

Should complete successfully without the `@layer` error.
