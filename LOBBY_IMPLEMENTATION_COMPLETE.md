# ✅ Lobby Configuration Complete - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Server:** rv2class-production (45.77.76.123)  
**Status:** ✅ CONFIGURED AND READY TO TEST

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **The Zoom-Style Approach**
Students connect to XMPP but are held in a lobby waiting room until teacher admits them.

### **Client-Side Changes** (Already Done)
✅ **File:** `jitsi-custom/jitsi-meet/react/features/teacher-auth/middleware.ts`

**For Students:**
- Allow XMPP connection (`next(action)`)
- Immediately show lobby screen (`openLobbyScreen()`)
- Start knocking after 100ms (`startKnocking()`)
- Student is connected but held in UI, not in conference

**For Teachers:**
- Bypass lobby completely (`hideLobbyScreen()`)
- Join directly as moderator
- Enable lobby immediately on join
- Can see and admit waiting students

### **Server-Side Changes** (Just Completed)
✅ **File:** `/etc/prosody/conf.avail/app.rv2class.com.cfg.lua`

**Configured:**
- `muc_lobby_rooms` module enabled
- Lobby MUC: `lobby.app.rv2class.com`
- Main MUC: `conference.app.rv2class.com`
- All Jitsi services restarted

## 🧪 Testing Flow

### **Test Case 1: Student Joins First** (Critical Test)
```
1. Student opens: https://app.rv2class.com/student-welcome.html?studentId=XXX
2. Student clicks "Join Class"
3. ✅ Student should see: "Waiting for host..." or lobby screen
4. ❌ Student should NOT enter the conference
5. Teacher starts lesson from landing page
6. ✅ Teacher joins as moderator
7. ✅ Teacher sees: "Student wants to join" notification
8. Teacher clicks "Admit"
9. ✅ Student enters conference
```

### **Test Case 2: Teacher Joins First** (Normal Flow)
```
1. Teacher clicks "Start Lesson" on landing page
2. ✅ Teacher joins directly (no lobby)
3. ✅ Teacher is moderator
4. Student clicks "Join Class"
5. ✅ Student sees lobby screen
6. ✅ Teacher sees knock notification
7. Teacher admits student
8. ✅ Student enters conference
```

## 🔍 How It Works (Technical Flow)

### **Student Flow:**
```
1. Click Join → CONFERENCE_WILL_JOIN triggered
2. Middleware detects userType !== 'teacher'
3. Middleware calls openLobbyScreen()
4. Connection proceeds: next(action)
5. Student connects to XMPP server ✅
6. Lobby UI holds them (doesn't join main MUC)
7. startKnocking() sends knock signal
8. Student waits in lobby.app.rv2class.com
9. Teacher admits → student joins main MUC
```

### **Teacher Flow:**
```
1. URL has userInfo.userType=teacher
2. Middleware calls hideLobbyScreen()
3. Connection proceeds: next(action)
4. Teacher joins main MUC directly
5. Becomes moderator (first or granted)
6. conference.enableLobby() called
7. Future students forced to lobby
```

## 📁 Files Changed

### **Client-Side**
1. `jitsi-custom/jitsi-meet/react/features/teacher-auth/middleware.ts`
   - Lines 143-165: Student lobby logic
   - Lines 243-250: Removed panic code
   
2. `jitsi-custom/jitsi-meet/config.js`
   - Lines 766-783: Lobby configuration (already configured)

### **Server-Side**
1. `/etc/prosody/conf.avail/app.rv2class.com.cfg.lua`
   - Added: `muc_lobby_rooms` module
   - Added: `lobby.app.rv2class.com` component
   - Configured: `lobby_muc` and `main_muc` settings

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Rebuild Jitsi Frontend**
```bash
cd /home/roman/Documents/rv2class-test/jitsi-custom/jitsi-meet
make
```

### **2. Deploy to Server**
```bash
# Copy built files to server
scp -r jitsi-custom/jitsi-meet/dist/* root@45.77.76.123:/usr/share/jitsi-meet/
```

### **3. Test Both Scenarios**
- Test student joining first
- Test teacher joining first
- Verify knocking works
- Verify admission works

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **If Student Still Joins Conference Directly:**
```bash
# Check Prosody logs
sshpass -p 'Wr2,Dyv(MK8PGgGL' ssh root@45.77.76.123 \
  "journalctl -u prosody -f"

# Verify lobby module loaded
sshpass -p 'Wr2,Dyv(MK8PGgGL' ssh root@45.77.76.123 \
  "grep muc_lobby_rooms /etc/prosody/conf.avail/app.rv2class.com.cfg.lua"
```

### **If Knocking Doesn't Work:**
- Check browser console for middleware logs
- Look for: `[TeacherAuth] Student starting knocking process...`
- Check network tab for XMPP knock messages

### **If Teacher Can't Admit:**
- Verify teacher became moderator (check logs)
- Ensure lobby was enabled: `conference.enableLobby()`
- Check participants panel for knock notifications

## 🎓 Key Concept (Zoom Approach)

**Old Approach (Blocked):**
```
Student → Middleware blocks → No connection → Can't knock ❌
```

**New Approach (Zoom-Style):**
```
Student → Allow connection → Connect to XMPP ✅
       → Show lobby UI → Hold in lobby MUC ✅
       → Send knock signal → Teacher admits ✅
```

The student **IS connected** to the XMPP server, but they're in the **lobby room**, not the **main conference room**. This is exactly how Zoom's waiting room works.
