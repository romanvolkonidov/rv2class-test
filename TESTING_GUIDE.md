cd ~/Documents/rv2class
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger Vercel redeploy"
git push origin main
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Still seeing BBB, not Jitsi option"

**Clear browser cache:**
- Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cache
- Or use Incognito mode

**Check Vercel logs:**
```bash
# Check latest deployment
vercel logs online-rv2class-com
```

### "Jitsi page won't load"

**Check server:**
```bash
ssh root@207.246.95.30
systemctl status nginx prosody jicofo jitsi-videobridge2
```

**Restart if needed:**
```bash
ssh root@207.246.95.30
systemctl restart nginx prosody jicofo jitsi-videobridge2 coturn
```

### "Camera/Mic not working"

**Check browser permissions:**
- Click lock icon in address bar
- Allow camera and microphone

**Check STUN server:**
- Should use: `stun:jitsi.rv2class.com:3478`
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for STUN connection logs

---

## 📊 Verify Everything is Using Your Server

**Open Browser DevTools (F12) on your app:**

1. Go to: `https://online.rv2class.com/room?teacher=roman&platform=jitsi`
2. Open Console tab
3. Look for:
   ```
   Loading Jitsi from: https://jitsi.rv2class.com/external_api.js ✅
   ```
4. Network tab should show:
   ```
   external_api.js - jitsi.rv2class.com ✅
   ```
