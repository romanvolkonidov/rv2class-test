## 🚧 What YOU Need to Do

### CRITICAL - Step 1: Set Up BBB Server
**You MUST do this before anything else works!**

Choose one option:

**Option A: Production Server (Recommended)**
```bash
# On Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 server with 8GB RAM
wget -qO- https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/bbb-install-2.7.sh | \
  bash -s -- -w -v focal-270 \
  -s tutoring.yourdomain.com \
  -e your@email.com

# Get credentials
bbb-conf --secret
```

**Option B: Use Hosted Service ($100-500/month)**
- Sign up at: https://blindsidenetworks.com
- Get your BBB_URL and BBB_SECRET

**Option C: Quick Docker Test (Development Only)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigbluebutton/docker
cd docker
./scripts/setup
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment
```bash
cd /home/roman/Documents/rv2class
cp .env.bbb.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your BBB credentials
nano .env.local
```

Add:
```
BBB_URL=https://your-bbb-server.com/bigbluebutton/
BBB_SECRET=your_secret_here
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Update Room Links
Find and replace all links to `/room` with `/bbb-room`:

```bash
# Find all room links
grep -r "/room?" app/ components/ --include="*.tsx"

# You'll need to manually update:
# - Tutor dashboard "Start Lesson" buttons
# - Student join links
# - Any navigation to video calls
```

Example change:
```tsx
// OLD
router.push(`/room?room=${roomName}&name=${userName}&tutor=true`);

// NEW
router.push(`/bbb-room?room=${roomName}&name=${userName}&tutor=true`);
```

### Step 5: Test Everything
```bash
npm run dev

# Visit: http://localhost:3000/bbb-room?room=test&name=TestUser&tutor=true
```

## 🗑️ Files You Can Remove (After Testing)

**DO NOT DELETE YET! Test BBB first, then:**

```bash
# Backup first
git add .
git commit -m "BBB migration - before cleanup"

# Remove old LiveKit code
rm -rf app/api/livekit-token/
rm -rf app/api/test-livekit/
mv app/room/page.tsx app/room/page.tsx.backup
mv components/CustomVideoConference.tsx components/CustomVideoConference.tsx.backup
mv components/CustomControlBar.tsx components/CustomControlBar.tsx.backup
mv components/CompactParticipantView.tsx components/CompactParticipantView.tsx.backup

# Optional: Remove audio agent (BBB has built-in audio processing)
# mv livekit-audio-agent livekit-audio-agent.backup
```

## 🔄 Migration Paths

### Path A: Full Migration (Recommended)
1. Set up BBB server
2. Configure environment
3. Update all links to use `/bbb-room`
4. Test with students
5. Deploy to production
6. Remove LiveKit code

### Path B: Gradual Migration
1. Set up BBB server
2. Keep both `/room` (LiveKit) and `/bbb-room` (BBB)
3. Use BBB for new lessons
4. Phase out LiveKit over time

### Path C: Hybrid (Both Systems)
1. Use BBB for group classes (3+ students)
2. Keep LiveKit for 1-on-1 (if it works)
3. Let users choose

## 🆚 Key Differences

### LiveKit vs BigBlueButton

| Feature | LiveKit (Old) | BBB (New) |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| **Reliability** | ⚠️ Join issues | ✅ Rock solid |
| **UI** | Custom React | BBB interface |
| **Whiteboard** | Excalidraw | BBB built-in |
| **Recording** | Complex | Built-in |
| **Setup** | Cloud service | Self-hosted |
| **Cost** | $99/month | $60-100/month |
| **Features** | Basic video | Classroom tools |

## 🎓 What Students/Tutors Will Notice

### Improvements ✅
1. **More reliable joining** - No more "accepted but can't join" issues
2. **Built-in whiteboard** - Better collaboration tools
3. **Recording access** - Easier to review lessons
4. **Polling/quizzes** - Interactive features
5. **Better mobile experience** - Native apps available

### Changes ⚠️
1. **Different UI** - BBB looks different (more professional)
2. **Different join process** - Redirects to BBB interface
3. **Browser requirements** - Modern browsers only

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I have to remove LiveKit immediately?**
A: No! You can keep both systems running and gradually migrate.

**Q: Can I use BBB's cloud service instead of self-hosting?**
A: Yes! Use Blindside Networks or another provider. Much easier.

**Q: Will my Excalidraw whiteboard still work?**
A: Yes, but BBB has a built-in whiteboard. You can keep Excalidraw as a separate tool or switch to BBB's whiteboard.

**Q: What about the DeepFilter audio agent?**
A: BBB has built-in audio processing. You can remove the DeepFilter agent or keep it as optional.

**Q: How much does self-hosting cost?**
A: $60-100/month for a server (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS). Or $100-500/month for hosted BBB.

**Q: Can students still join from mobile?**
A: Yes! BBB works in mobile browsers and has native apps.

**Q: What if BBB doesn't work?**
A: Keep your LiveKit backups! You can restore them at any time.
