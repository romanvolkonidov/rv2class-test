# Meeting End Error Fix

## Problem
When a teacher ended a meeting, they were incorrectly shown a "Connection Error" dialog with the message:
```
An error occurred in the meeting. Redirecting...
```

## Root Cause
Looking at the console logs:
```
2025-10-15T15:45:29.991Z [ERROR] [app:conference-web] <P9._onConferenceFailed>:  
CONFERENCE FAILED: conference.destroyed The meeting has been terminated undefined
```

When a teacher clicks "Leave" or ends the meeting, Jitsi fires **TWO** events:
1. ✅ `videoConferenceLeft` - The normal, expected event
2. ❌ `errorOccurred` with error name `conference.destroyed`

The problem: **`conference.destroyed` is NOT an actual error** - it's just Jitsi's way of notifying that the conference was intentionally ended. However, our code was treating it as a critical error and showing the error dialog to the user.

## Solution
Modified the `errorOccurred` event handler in `components/JitsiRoom.tsx` to **filter out** the `conference.destroyed` error:

```typescript
api.addEventListener("errorOccurred", (event: any) => {
  console.error("Jitsi error:", event);
  
  // Ignore "conference.destroyed" - it's fired when teacher ends meeting normally
  const errorName = event?.error?.name || "";
  if (errorName === "conference.destroyed") {
    console.log("Jitsi: Conference destroyed (normal meeting end), ignoring error");
    return; // ← EXIT EARLY, don't show error
  }
  
  // ... rest of error handling for REAL errors
});
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Teacher clicks "Leave" → Meeting ends cleanly → Redirects to home (no error shown)
- ✅ Student clicks "Leave" → Shows feedback form (no error shown)
- ✅ Real connection errors → Still show error dialog (preserved functionality)

## Testing
Test by:
1. Teacher starts a meeting
2. Teacher clicks "Leave" or hangup button
3. Should see smooth redirect to home WITHOUT the "Connection Error" dialog
