# React Migration Complete - Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Logo Size - Made 4x Bigger

**Changed Files:**

1. **`css/_variables.scss`** - Updated watermark size variables:
   ```scss
   $watermarkWidth: 284px;    // Was 71px (4x bigger)
   $watermarkHeight: 128px;   // Was 32px (4x bigger)
   $welcomePageWatermarkWidth: 284px;
   $welcomePageWatermarkHeight: 128px;
   ```

2. **`css/_base.scss`** - Updated max dimensions for leftwatermark:
   ```scss
   .leftwatermark {
       max-width: 560px;   // Was 140px (4x bigger)
       max-height: 280px;  // Was 70px (4x bigger)
   }
   ```

3. **`css/_welcome_page.scss`** - Updated prejoin/welcome page watermark:
   ```scss
   .welcome-watermark .watermark.leftwatermark {
       width: $welcomePageWatermarkWidth;
       height: $welcomePageWatermarkHeight;
       max-width: 560px;   // Added (4x bigger)
       max-height: 280px;  // Added (4x bigger)
   }
   ```

**Result**: RV2Class logo now displays 4x larger in:
- ✅ Meeting interface
- ✅ Prejoin screen (camera preview)
- ✅ Welcome page

### 2. React Dashboard - Fully Complete

**File**: `react/features/teacher-auth/components/TeacherAuthPage.tsx`

**Added Features:**

1. **Firebase/Firestore Integration** ✅
   - Loads Firebase App, Auth, and Firestore modules
   - Initializes on component mount
   - Handles authentication state

2. **Unread Homework Badge** ✅
   - State: `const [unreadCount, setUnreadCount] = useState(0);`
   - Function: `loadUnreadCount(teacherEmail)`
   - Queries Firestore for unread submissions
   - Displays orange badge on Homeworks button
   - Badge only shows when count > 0

3. **Shared Teacher Support** ✅
   - Recognizes shared teacher emails
   - Queries correct Firestore collection
   - Counts unread across all students

**Badge Styling:**
```typescript
homeworkBadge: {
    position: 'absolute',
    top: '-8px',
    right: '-8px',
    background: '#e04757',
    color: '#ffffff',
    borderRadius: '50%',
    width: '28px',
    height: '28px',
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    fontSize: '12px',
    fontWeight: 700,
    boxShadow: '0 2px 8px rgba(224, 71, 87, 0.5)',
    border: '2px solid #ffffff'
}
```

**Firestore Query Logic:**
```typescript
const loadUnreadCount = async (teacherEmail: string) => {
    const db = window.firebaseFirestore.getFirestore(app);
    
    // Get teacher's viewed list
    const viewedDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'teacherViewed', teacherEmail));
    const viewedIds = viewedDoc.data()?.viewedHomeworks || [];
    
    // Query student submissions
    const isShared = SHARED_TEACHER_EMAILS.includes(teacherEmail);
    // ... query logic for shared vs individual teachers
    
    // Count unreviewed
    const unread = submissions.filter(s => !viewedIds.includes(s.id)).length;
    setUnreadCount(unread);
};
```

### 3. Removed Redundant HTML Files

**Archived Files** (moved to `archive/html-backup/`):

1. ❌ `jitsi-custom/landing.html` → Replaced by React `TeacherAuthPage.tsx`
2. ❌ `jitsi-custom/jitsi-meet/landing.html` → Duplicate, removed

**Why Removed:**
- React TeacherAuthPage now has **feature parity** with HTML version
- No longer needed for development or production
- Reduces confusion and maintenance burden

**Still Kept (Temporarily):**
- `students.html` - No React replacement yet
- `teacher-homeworks.html` - No React replacement yet
- `auth-page.html` - No React replacement yet
- Student portal HTML files - Have React versions but keeping both for now

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional Future Improvements)

### Still Using HTML (Not Critical):
1. **Students Management** (`students.html`)
   - Status: Works fine as-is
   - Future: Could migrate to React for consistency

2. **Teacher Homeworks Review** (`teacher-homeworks.html`)
   - Status: Works fine as-is
   - Future: Could migrate to React for consistency

3. **Auth Page** (`auth-page.html`)
   - Status: Works fine as-is
   - Future: Could migrate to React for consistency

### When to Migrate:
- ✅ Keep HTML if it's working well (no urgent need)
- ⚠️ Migrate when adding new features to those pages
- ⚠️ Migrate if maintaining two codebases becomes tedious
