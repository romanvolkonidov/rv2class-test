# Text Annotation Duplication Fix

## Problem
Text annotations on shared screen were duplicating when:
1. **Editing** - When updating the text content of an existing annotation, it would appear twice
2. **Dragging** - When moving a text annotation, multiple copies would appear

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `useDataChannel` handler in `AnnotationOverlay.tsx`:

```tsx
// OLD CODE - BUGGY
setRemoteActions(prev => [...prev, action]);
```

This code **always added** new actions to the `remoteActions` array, even when receiving updates to existing annotations. When a text annotation was edited or dragged, the system would broadcast the updated annotation with the same ID, but instead of replacing the old one, it would add a duplicate.

## Solution
Three key fixes were implemented:

### Fix 1: Check for Existing Actions by ID
Updated the `useDataChannel` handler to check if an action with the same ID already exists:

```tsx
setRemoteActions(prev => {
  const existingIndex = prev.findIndex(a => a.id === action.id);
  if (existingIndex !== -1) {
    // Update existing action (for text edits, drags, etc.)
    const updated = [...prev];
    updated[existingIndex] = action;
    return updated;
  } else {
    // Add new action
    return [...prev, action];
  }
});
```

### Fix 2: Redraw Canvas After Remote Updates
Changed from drawing only the single action to redrawing the entire canvas:

```tsx
// Use redrawCanvas() instead of drawAction(action)
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  if (canvasRef.current) {
    redrawCanvas();
  }
});
```

This ensures the canvas properly reflects the updated state without duplicates.

### Fix 3: Redraw Canvas During Dragging
Added `redrawCanvas()` calls in the text dragging handler:

```tsx
// After updating history
setHistory(updatedHistory);
requestAnimationFrame(() => redrawCanvas());

// After updating remote actions
setRemoteActions(updatedRemote);
requestAnimationFrame(() => redrawCanvas());
```

This ensures the canvas updates smoothly as text is dragged.

## Testing
To verify the fix:

1. **Test Text Editing**:
   - Create a text annotation
   - Edit it by clicking on it (pointer tool)
   - Verify it doesn't duplicate

2. **Test Text Dragging**:
   - Create a text annotation
   - Click the control button and select "Move"
   - Drag the text around
   - Verify no duplicates appear

3. **Test Remote Updates**:
   - Have two participants in the same room
   - One creates a text annotation
   - The other should see it without duplicates
   - Edit or drag it - the other participant should see the update without duplicates
