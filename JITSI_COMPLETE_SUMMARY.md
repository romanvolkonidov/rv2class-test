## Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### Issue: Jitsi not loading
**Fix**: Check browser console, clear cache, try incognito mode

### Issue: No video/audio
**Fix**: Check browser permissions, refresh page

### Issue: Poor video quality  
**Fix**: Check internet speed, close other apps, try audio-only

### Issue: Connection drops
**Fix**: Restart router, try different browser, check internet connection

### Issue: Student joins wrong platform
**Fix**: Check Firebase `activeRooms` collection has correct platform

## Monitoring

### Check Connection Quality
While in Jitsi call:
1. Open `chrome://webrtc-internals/`
2. Look for "Connection State: connected"
3. Check packet loss (should be < 1%)

### Firebase Data
Check `activeRooms` collection:
```javascript
{
  teacher: "Roman",
  platform: "jitsi",  // or "bbb"
  roomName: "roman",
  startedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## Future Scaling (When Needed)

### If You Grow To:
- 10+ concurrent students
- 5+ teachers
- Corporate clients with strict firewalls
- Compliance requirements

**Then consider**:
- Self-hosted Jitsi server
- Dedicated Coturn server (use `setup-coturn-vultr.sh`)
- Multi-region deployment
- Recording infrastructure

### Until Then

- Save $72-144/year ✅
- No maintenance overhead ✅
- Perfect for your needs ✅
