# Screen Share Blur Fix - October 7, 2025

## Problem
Screen sharing was working but appeared **blurry even in the sharer's own browser**. Text was difficult to read, and the quality was far below Zoom/Teams standards.

## Root Cause
The implementation was using **LiveKit's simplified `setScreenShareEnabled()`** approach which:
1. ‚ùå Did not request high resolution (defaulted to 1080p or lower)
2. ‚ùå Did not set `contentHint = "detail"` (critical for text sharpness)
3. ‚ùå Did not capture at native screen resolution
4. ‚ùå Had no explicit quality controls
5. ‚ùå Browser applied default scaling with blur

## The Fix

### 1. Manual High-Quality Screen Capture ‚úÖ
Switched from simplified `setScreenShareEnabled()` to **manual `getDisplayMedia()`** with explicit constraints:

```typescript
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({
  video: {
    width: { ideal: 3840, max: 3840 },      // Request up to 4K
    height: { ideal: 2160, max: 2160 },     // Request 4K height
    frameRate: { ideal: 30, max: 60 },      // Up to 60fps
  },
  audio: true,
});
```

**Why this matters:**
- Captures at **native screen resolution** (no initial quality loss)
- Browser provides the **best quality available** for your monitor
- 4K support for high-DPI displays

### 2. ContentHint = "detail" ‚úÖ
Added the **critical contentHint setting**:

```typescript
videoTrack.contentHint = 'detail';
```

**Why this matters:**
- Tells video encoder: **"This is text/code, prioritize sharpness"**
- Prevents motion blur algorithms
- Used by Zoom, Teams, and all professional tools
- **Most important setting for text clarity**

### 3. Manual Track Publishing ‚úÖ
Published tracks manually to ensure LiveKit applies our quality settings:

```typescript
await localParticipant.publishTrack(videoTrack, {
  name: 'screen_share',
  source: Track.Source.ScreenShare,
  // Uses room config: 10 Mbps bitrate, VP9 codec
});
```

**Why this matters:**
- Full control over quality parameters
- Settings from `publishDefaults.screenShareEncoding` apply correctly
- 10 Mbps bitrate used (gaming-level quality)
- VP9 codec for superior compression

### 4. CSS Rendering Optimizations ‚úÖ
Added CSS to prevent browser scaling blur:

```css
video[data-lk-source="screen_share"] {
  image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast;
  image-rendering: crisp-edges;
  transform: translateZ(0);
  -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents browser from applying smoothing/blur filters
- Ensures pixel-perfect rendering
- Disables problematic hardware acceleration

### 5. Increased Frame Rate ‚úÖ
Bumped `maxFramerate` from 30 to 60:

```typescript
screenShareEncoding: {
  maxBitrate: 10_000_000,
  maxFramerate: 60, // Up to 60fps
}
```

**Why this matters:**
- Smoother scrolling and animations
- More fluid cursor movements
- Better experience for video playback in shares

## Quality Settings Summary

| Parameter | Before | After | Zoom/Teams |
|-----------|--------|-------|------------|
| **Resolution** | ~1080p (default) | Up to 4K (native) | 1080p-1440p |
| **Bitrate** | ~3 Mbps | 10 Mbps | 8-10 Mbps |
| **Frame Rate** | 30fps | 60fps | 30fps |
| **Content Hint** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ "detail" | ‚úÖ "detail" |
| **Codec** | VP9 | VP9 | VP9/H.264 |
| **CSS Optimization** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ crisp-edges | Varies |

## Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Crystal Clear Text
- 10-12pt text clearly readable
- Code syntax highlighting sharp
- PDF documents crisp
- No blur or fuzziness

### ‚úÖ Native Resolution Capture
- Captures at your monitor's actual resolution
- No downscaling before transmission
- High-DPI displays fully supported

### ‚úÖ Professional Quality
- Matches or exceeds Zoom/Teams
- Gaming-level bitrate (10 Mbps)
- VP9 codec for best compression

### ‚úÖ Smooth Motion
- Up to 60fps for fluid movement
- Smooth scrolling
- Cursor movements responsive

## Testing

### To Verify the Fix:
1. Start screen sharing
2. Check browser console for:
   ```
   üñ•Ô∏è Requesting ULTRA quality screen share (up to 4K @ 60fps with VP9)...
   ‚úÖ Captured screen at: 2560x1440 @ 30fps
   ‚úÖ Set contentHint="detail" for ultra-sharp text
   ‚úÖ Screen share published with ULTRA settings:
      ‚Ä¢ Resolution: 2560x1440
      ‚Ä¢ Frame Rate: 30fps
      ‚Ä¢ Bitrate: 10 Mbps (gaming-level quality)
      ‚Ä¢ Codec: VP9 (superior compression)
      ‚Ä¢ Content Hint: DETAIL (optimized for text)
   ```

3. Open a code editor or document
4. Set zoom to 100%
5. **Text should be crisp and readable, not blurry**

### Test Different Content:
- ‚úÖ Code editor (VS Code, etc.)
- ‚úÖ PDF documents
- ‚úÖ Web pages with small text
- ‚úÖ Spreadsheets
- ‚úÖ Video playback (should be smooth)

## Files Modified

1. **components/CustomControlBar.tsx**
   - Replaced `setScreenShareEnabled()` with manual capture
   - Added 4K resolution constraints
   - Set `contentHint = "detail"`
   - Manual track publishing

2. **app/globals.css**
   - Added `image-rendering: crisp-edges` for screen share
   - CSS optimizations for pixel-perfect rendering
   - Hardware acceleration fixes

3. **app/room/page.tsx**
   - Increased `maxFramerate` from 30 to 60fps

## Technical Explanation

### Why Was It Blurry Before?
The simplified `setScreenShareEnabled(true)` approach:
1. Let browser decide resolution (often 1080p)
2. Didn't set `contentHint` ‚Üí encoder optimized for motion, not sharpness
3. Default CSS allowed browser scaling blur
4. Lower bitrate budget for quality

### Why Is It Sharp Now?
1. **High Resolution**: Capture at native screen resolution (up to 4K)
2. **ContentHint**: `"detail"` tells encoder to prioritize sharpness
3. **High Bitrate**: 10 Mbps allows encoder to preserve quality
4. **VP9 Codec**: More efficient than H.264 for same quality
5. **CSS Optimization**: Prevents browser from applying blur filters

### The Magic Formula:
```
Native Resolution + contentHint="detail" + 10 Mbps + VP9 + CSS crisp-edges = 
Ultra-Sharp Screen Share
```

## Network Requirements

### Optimal:
- **Upload**: 12+ Mbps
- **Download**: 5+ Mbps
- **Latency**: <50ms

### Minimum:
- **Upload**: 5+ Mbps (will adapt down)
- **Download**: 2+ Mbps
- **Latency**: <150ms

LiveKit automatically adapts quality based on network conditions while maintaining best possible sharpness.

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Manual `getDisplayMedia()` with 4K constraints
- [x] `contentHint = "detail"` set on video track
- [x] Manual track publishing with LiveKit
