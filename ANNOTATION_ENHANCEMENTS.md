# Annotation Tool Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the annotation tool with two major features:
1. **Pointer tool for text editing** - Click on existing text annotations to edit them
2. **Selective clear options for teachers** - Choose what to remove: all drawings, teacher's drawings, or students' drawings

## Features Implemented

### 1. Pointer Tool with Text Editing

#### What it does:
- New pointer tool (mouse cursor icon) added to the toolbar
- Click on any text annotation to edit it
- **Teachers** can edit ALL text annotations (from any participant)
- **Students** can only edit THEIR OWN text annotations
- When clicked, the text editor opens with the existing text, allowing you to modify it

#### How it works:
- Tool type `"pointer"` added to `AnnotationTool` type
- `findTextAtPoint()` function detects when a click intersects with a text annotation's bounding box
- Permission check: `isTutor || clickedText.author === room.localParticipant.identity`
- Edit mode reuses the existing text input interface with "Update" button instead of "Add"
- Edited text maintains its position but updates content, color, and font size

### 2. Author Tracking

#### What it does:
- Every annotation now tracks who created it
- Enables permission-based editing and selective clearing

#### Implementation:
- Added `author?: string` field to `AnnotationAction` interface
- Added `id?: string` field for unique identification of annotations
- All drawing actions (pencil, eraser, shapes, text) now include:
  - `author: room.localParticipant.identity`
  - `id: ${room.localParticipant.identity}-${Date.now()}`

### 3. Selective Clear for Teachers

#### What it does:
- **Teachers** see a dropdown menu when clicking the trash/bin icon with 3 options:
  - Clear All Drawings
  - Clear Teacher's Drawings (only)
  - Clear Students' Drawings (only)
- **Students** still see the simple "Clear All" button

#### How it works:
- `showClearOptions` state controls dropdown visibility
- `clearByAuthor()` function filters annotations based on selection:
  - `"all"` - removes everything
  - `"teacher"` - removes annotations where `author === teacherIdentity`
  - `"students"` - removes annotations where `author !== teacherIdentity`
- Broadcasts selective clear via data channel with type `"clearAnnotationsByType"`
- All participants receive and apply the same filter
- Click outside closes the dropdown automatically

### 4. Data Synchronization

#### New message type:
```typescript
{
  type: "clearAnnotationsByType",
  authorType: "all" | "teacher" | "students",
  teacherIdentity: string
}
```

This ensures all participants see the same state after selective clearing.

## UI Changes

### Toolbar Updates:
1. **Pointer tool button** (first button in drawing tools section)
   - MousePointer2 icon from lucide-react
   - Tooltip: "Pointer - Click text to edit"
   - Active state styling matches other tools

2. **Clear button** (for teachers)
   - Now shows a dropdown menu with 3 options
   - Positioned above the button (bottom-full)
   - Glass morphism styling matches toolbar aesthetic
   - Available in both expanded and collapsed toolbar states

3. **Text editing indicator**
   - Button text changes from "Add" to "Update" when editing existing text
