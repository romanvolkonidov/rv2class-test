# üéØ Jitsi Deployment - Your Decision Guide

## Summary: What You're Trying to Decide

You want custom Jitsi features and you're wondering:
- Should I deploy on Fly.io?
- Should I deploy on Vultr?
- Should I just use meet.jit.si?

## The Clear Answer

**For Jitsi specifically: Vultr VPS >> Fly.io**

Here's why:

### ‚ùå Jitsi on Fly.io: Bad Fit

**Problems:**
1. **Multi-service nightmare**: Jitsi needs 4+ separate services
2. **Cost**: $40-80/month for multiple Fly apps
3. **Complexity**: Inter-service networking is painful
4. **UDP limitations**: JVB needs UDP port 10000, Fly handles this poorly
5. **Not designed for it**: Fly is for stateless apps, Jitsi is stateful

**Reality**: You'd be fighting Fly.io the whole way

### ‚úÖ Jitsi on Vultr: Perfect Fit

**Benefits:**
1. **Single VPS**: Everything on one machine ($12-24/month)
2. **Simple**: Official Jitsi install script works perfectly
3. **Full control**: All ports, all features
4. **Better performance**: No network hops between services
5. **Easier maintenance**: Standard Linux server management

**Reality**: This is how Jitsi is meant to be deployed

### üéâ meet.jit.si: Best for Your Scale

**Benefits:**
1. **FREE**: $0/month
2. **Global CDN**: Faster than anything you can deploy
3. **Zero maintenance**: They handle everything
4. **Battle-tested**: Millions of users
5. **Perfect for 2 teachers**: No need to over-engineer

## My Specific Recommendation for YOU

Based on:
- 2 teachers (Roman & Violet)
- Mostly 1-on-1 lessons
- Rarely 2 students
- You mentioned "custom features later"

### Phase 1: NOW (Next 3-6 months)
**Use meet.jit.si** ‚úÖ
- Already implemented
- FREE
- Works perfectly for your scale
- Save $216-960/year

### Phase 2: WHEN YOU NEED CUSTOM FEATURES (6-12 months)
**Deploy on Vultr** ‚úÖ
- Create $12-24/month VPS
- Run `./install-jitsi-vultr.sh`
- Takes 30 minutes
- Full control, all features

### Phase 3: NEVER
**Deploy on Fly.io** ‚ùå
- Too expensive
- Too complex
- No real benefit

## Coturn: Yes, Do This

**Regardless of Jitsi choice, deploy Coturn on Vultr:**

```bash
# Create $6/month Vultr VPS
# SSH into it
./setup-coturn-vultr.sh
```

**Why?**
- Helps BBB connectivity
- Helps Jitsi (even meet.jit.si)
- Only $6/month
- Easy to maintain
- Good backup for NAT traversal

## Cost Comparison

| Setup | Year 1 | Year 2 | Complexity |
|-------|--------|--------|------------|
| **meet.jit.si only** | $0 | $0 | None |
| **meet.jit.si + Coturn** | $72 | $72 | Low |
| **Jitsi on Vultr + Coturn** | $216-360 | $216-360 | Medium |
| **Jitsi on Fly.io + Coturn** | $552-1032 | $552-1032 | High |

## Action Plan

### Option A: Minimalist (Recommended for Now) ‚úÖ

**Cost: $0/month**

```bash
# Do nothing! Your current setup works
# Frontend already uses meet.jit.si
# Just deploy updates to Vercel
```

**When to upgrade**: When you actually need custom features

### Option B: Add Coturn Backup ‚úÖ

**Cost: $6/month**

```bash
# Create Vultr Ubuntu 22.04 VPS ($6/month)
# SSH into it
./setup-coturn-vultr.sh

# Update JitsiRoom.tsx with Coturn IP
# Deploy to Vercel
```

**Benefit**: Better connectivity, helps BBB too

### Option C: Full Self-Hosted (When You Need It)

**Cost: $18-30/month**

```bash
# Create Vultr Ubuntu 22.04 VPS ($12-24/month)
# Point jitsi.rv2class.com to VPS IP
# SSH into it
./install-jitsi-vultr.sh

# Update JitsiRoom.tsx:
const domain = "jitsi.rv2class.com";

# Deploy to Vercel
```

**When**: When you need recordings, custom branding, etc.

## The Scripts You Have

I've created 3 deployment options:

1. **`setup-coturn-vultr.sh`** ‚úÖ **Use This First**
   - Deploys Coturn on Vultr
   - $6/month
   - Helps both BBB and Jitsi
   - Easy win

2. **`install-jitsi-vultr.sh`** ‚úÖ **Use When You Need Features**
   - Full Jitsi on Vultr VPS
   - $12-24/month
   - Complete control
   - When you actually need custom features

3. **`deploy-jitsi-complete.sh`** ‚ùå **Don't Use**
   - Attempts Fly.io deployment
   - Complicated and expensive
   - Not recommended

## My Strong Advice

### Do This Today:
1. ‚úÖ Deploy Coturn on Vultr ($6/month)
   ```bash
   # Create Vultr VPS
   ./setup-coturn-vultr.sh
   ```

2. ‚úÖ Keep using meet.jit.si (FREE)
   - Your current JitsiRoom.tsx setup

3. ‚úÖ Deploy your frontend updates to Vercel
   - New platform selector works great
   - Students auto-detect platform

### Total Cost: $6/month (for Coturn)
### Time Saved: Hours
### Money Saved: $210-1026/year vs other options

### Do This Later (When You Need It):
1. Create subdomain: jitsi.rv2class.com
2. Create Vultr VPS for Jitsi
3. Run `./install-jitsi-vultr.sh`
4. Update frontend domain
5. Redeploy

## Questions?

**Q: But isn't Fly.io's edge network better?**
A: Not for Jitsi. meet.jit.si already HAS global edge. And Vultr + Coturn works fine for your 2-teacher scale.

**Q: What if I want to try Fly.io anyway?**
A: You can, but you'll waste time and money. I strongly advise against it for Jitsi.

**Q: When would I actually need self-hosted Jitsi?**
A: When you need: recordings saved to your server, custom branding, compliance requirements, or custom integrations.

**Q: How long until I need those features?**
A: Based on your usage (2 teachers, 1-on-1), probably 6-12 months minimum. Start with free, upgrade when needed.

## Ready to Deploy?

**Recommended path:**
```bash
# Step 1: Deploy Coturn (30 minutes)
# Create Vultr VPS: Ubuntu 22.04, $6/month
ssh root@YOUR_VULTR_IP
./setup-coturn-vultr.sh

# Step 2: Keep everything else as-is
# Your frontend already works with meet.jit.si

# Step 3: Profit! üí∞
# Save $216-1026/year
```

**Total time: 30 minutes**
**Total cost: $6/month**
**Total benefit: Better connectivity for both BBB and Jitsi**
