# Teacher Portal & Student Management - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented a complete teacher portal with student management in Jitsi Meet's style. Teachers can now:
1. Manage their students
2. Generate unique welcome links for each student
3. Students get personalized welcome pages before joining lessons

## 🏗️ Architecture

### User Flow

**Teacher Flow:**
1. Login with Google Firebase → `auth.html` (/)
2. Teacher Home → Choose "Start a Lesson" or "Students"
3. Students Management → Add/manage students, get links
4. Start Lesson → Goes to their permanent room prejoin

**Student Flow:**
1. Click personalized link → `/student/{studentId}`
2. Student Welcome Page → Shows student name, lesson info
3. Click "Join Lesson" → Goes to teacher's room prejoin
4. Prejoin → Camera/mic setup
5. Join meeting

### Room Structure

- **Each teacher has a permanent room**: `teacher-{uid}`
  - Example: `teacher-abc12345`
  - Never changes, same room for all lessons
  - Students join this room

## 📁 Files Created

### 1. `/jitsi-custom/students.html`
**Purpose**: Students management page for teachers

**Features**:
- Add students manually by name
- Auto-generate unique student welcome links
- Copy/open student links
- Delete students (own students only)
- Firebase integration with two collection strategies:
  - `romanvolkonidov@gmail.com` & `violetta6520@gmail.com` → Shared `students` collection
  - All other teachers → Personal `teacherStudents` collection

**Styling**: Full Jitsi theme (dark #1E1E1E background, #292929 cards, #3D7CC9 buttons)

**Collections Structure**:
```javascript
// Shared collection (Roman & Violetta)
students: {
  name: string
  teacher: string
  createdAt: string
  createdBy: string (email)
}

// Teacher-specific collection
teacherStudents: {
  name: string
  teacherEmail: string
  teacherName: string
  createdAt: string
}
```

### 2. `/jitsi-custom/student-welcome.html`
**Purpose**: Student's personalized welcome page

**Features**:
- Displays student name prominently
- Shows teacher name
- "Join Lesson" button → redirects to teacher's room
- Pre-lesson checklist (camera, mic, quiet place)
- Loads student data from Firebase (checks both collections)

**URL Pattern**: `/student/{studentId}`

### 3. `/jitsi-custom/auth-page.html` (updated)
**Purpose**: Updated teacher home to link to students page

**Changes**:
- "Students" button now goes to `/students` instead of alert
- Still maintains "Start a Lesson" → teacher's permanent room

## 🌐 Nginx Routes Added

```nginx
# Students management page
location = /students {
    root /usr/share/jitsi-meet;
    charset utf-8;
    try_files /students.html =404;
}

# Student welcome pages
location ~ ^/student/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ {
    root /usr/share/jitsi-meet;
    charset utf-8;
    try_files /student-welcome.html =404;
}

# Teacher rooms (already exists)
location ~ ^/teacher-[a-zA-Z0-9]+$ {
    root /usr/share/jitsi-meet;
    charset utf-8;
    try_files /room.html =404;
}
```

## 🔥 Firebase Collections

### Collection Strategy

**Shared List Users** (Roman & Violetta):
- Email: `romanvolkonidov@gmail.com` or `violetta6520@gmail.com`
- Collection: `students` (shared, read-only for deletion)
- Can see all students in shared list
- Can only delete students they created

**All Other Teachers**:
- Collection: `teacherStudents` (filtered by `teacherEmail`)
- Each teacher sees only their own students
- Full CRUD permissions on their students

### Why Two Collections?

1. **Backwards compatibility**: Roman & Violetta already have students in the `students` collection from the Next.js app
2. **Scalability**: New teachers get their own isolated student lists
3. **Security**: Teachers can't see each other's students

## 🎨 Design Consistency

All pages use Jitsi's exact color scheme:
- Background: `#1E1E1E`
- Cards: `#292929`
- Primary button: `#3D7CC9`
- Hover: `#4A8BD6`
- Text primary: `#E7E7E7`
- Text secondary: `#A4B5B8`
- Borders: `#525A5E`

## 🔗 URL Structure

```
https://app.rv2class.com/
├── / (root)                    → Auth page (Google login)
├── /students                   → Students management (teachers only, auth required)
├── /student/{id}               → Student welcome page (public link)
├── /teacher-{uid}              → Teacher's permanent room (auth required)
└── /{any-room-name}           → Generic room (auth required)
```
