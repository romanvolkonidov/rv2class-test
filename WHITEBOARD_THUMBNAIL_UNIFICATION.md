# Whiteboard Thumbnail Unification

## Overview
Unified the thumbnail components so that whiteboard mode uses the same draggable, resizable thumbnail container with all controls that screen share mode has.

## Changes Made

### File: `components/CompactParticipantView.tsx`

**Before:**
- Simple draggable container with basic drag functionality
- No resize capability
- No minimize/maximize button
- No hide/show local camera button
- Simple drag handle with "Drag anywhere" text
- Thumbnails arranged vertically in a column

**After:**
- Full-featured `DraggableThumbnailContainer` (same as screen share mode)
- Resizable with corner handles (hover to see resize corners)
- Scale range: 0.5x to 3x
- Minimize/maximize button to hide/show thumbnails
- Hide/show local camera button (eye icon)
- Professional drag handle with grip icon
- Thumbnails arranged horizontally in a row
- Better z-index management (z-50 by default, z-100 when dragging)

### Features Now Available in Whiteboard Mode

1. **Drag to Move**
   - Click and drag the drag handle (with grip icon) to move the entire thumbnail container
   - Stays within viewport bounds

2. **Resize**
   - Hover over the thumbnail container to reveal resize handles in the corners
   - Click and drag any corner to resize proportionally
   - Maintains aspect ratio during resize
   - Scale range: 0.5x to 3x of original size

3. **Minimize/Maximize**
   - Click the minimize button to hide all thumbnails but keep the control bar
   - Click maximize to show them again
   - Useful when you need more whiteboard space

4. **Hide/Show Local Camera**
   - Click the eye/X icon to hide your own camera thumbnail
   - Click again to show it
   - Useful when you want to focus on remote participants

5. **Tutor Controls** (when isTutor=true)
   - Hover over any student thumbnail to see control buttons
   - "Stop Share" button - stops the student's screen share
   - "Remove" button - removes the student from the room
   - Both buttons show in the top-left corner of each thumbnail

### Visual Consistency

Both screen share mode and whiteboard mode now use identical thumbnail containers:
- Same glassmorphism design (black/60 with backdrop blur)
- Same border styling (white/20)
- Same speaking indicator (blue outline when speaking)
- Same muted microphone indicator (red icon top-right)
- Same control buttons and interactions
- Same z-index behavior

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Users have the same experience in both modes
2. **Control**: More control options (resize, minimize, hide local)
3. **Space Management**: Can minimize or resize thumbnails to get more whiteboard space
4. **Professional UX**: Matches the polished feel of the screen share mode

## Technical Details

- Removed old simple drag implementation
- Imported full `DraggableThumbnailContainer` component logic
- Kept all existing tutor control functionality (remove student, stop screen share)
- Maintained all participant tracking and LiveKit integration
- Used transform/scale for smooth resizing with proper performance
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth dragging

## Backward Compatibility

All existing functionality is preserved:
- Tutor can still remove students
- Tutor can still stop student screen shares
- All participants are displayed correctly
- Audio and video still work as before
- Speaking indicators still work
- Muted indicators still work

The only difference is better UI/UX with more control options.
