# 🎯 Quick Fix: Blurry Screen Share

## What You're Seeing
Looking at your screenshot, the screen share is **extremely blurry** with barely readable text. This is NOT a code issue!

## The Problem
You're selecting **"Chrome Tab"** in the screen share picker, which captures a low-resolution preview/thumbnail instead of the actual content.

## The Solution (2 seconds to fix!)

### When You Click "Share Screen":

**❌ WRONG (What you're doing now):**
```
Chrome Picker appears
├── Chrome Tab  ← You're clicking HERE (BAD!)
├── Window
└── Entire Screen
```

**✅ CORRECT (Do this instead):**
```
Chrome Picker appears
├── Chrome Tab
├── Window      ← Click HERE for browser window (GOOD)
└── Entire Screen  ← Or click HERE for full screen (BEST)
```

## Why This Matters

### "Chrome Tab" Sharing:
- ❌ Captures a **thumbnail preview** at ~480-720p
- ❌ Extreme blur and quality loss
- ❌ Layout may appear different
- ❌ Text is unreadable
- 🤷 This is a Chrome limitation, not fixable in code

### "Window" or "Entire Screen" Sharing:
- ✅ Captures at **full native resolution** (1080p, 1440p, 4K)
- ✅ Crystal clear text
- ✅ Perfect layout
- ✅ Professional quality like Zoom/Teams

## Try It Now!
1. Stop your current screen share
2. Click screen share button again
3. In the picker, select **"Window"** or **"Entire Screen"**
4. The quality will be **instantly perfect**

## Code Changes Made
I've updated your `CustomControlBar.tsx` to show a **confirmation dialog** before sharing that reminds you to select the right option. This will prevent the "Chrome Tab" mistake in the future.

## Need Help?
- If it's still blurry: Double-check you selected "Window" or "Entire Screen"
- If you need privacy: Select "Window" to share only your browser
- For best quality: Always select "Entire Screen"
